    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy to make homemade pancake recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>3 cups flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
        in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Mix the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate
        large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan to medium heat.
        If you drip water onto the surface and it sizzles it's ready.
    </li>    
    <li>Carefully pour the bowl with the wet mixture into the bowl with
        the dry mixture. Mix until it's just blended together. It's
        fine if it's a little lumpy.
    </li>
    <li>Pour approximately half a cup of the batter onto the griddle
        or frying pan. Cook for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on the surface.
        Flip with a spatula and cook until the other side is also browned.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the previous step until there is no more batter left. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
