<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An easy to make homemade ravioli recipe.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 cups flour</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup shreded provolone cheese</li>
<li>1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
<li>Cold Water</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
<li>Mound the flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the center.
    Add 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the well and beat 
    them together with a fork.
</li>
<li>Gradually mix the egg mixture into the flour. 
    Work from the center out and use your hand to keep the flour mound steady
    until a thick paste forms. Then pressin the remaining flour until
    a shaggy dough forms.
</li>
<li>Knead the dough for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.</li>
<li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at
    least 30 minutes, no more than 2 hours. While the dough is resting, 
    prepare the ravioli filling.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl stir the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, 
    provolone cheese, parmesan cheese, parsley, 
    and the remaining egg and salt until well combined. </li>
<li>Divide the dough into 4 even portions and wrap each portion
    in plastic wrap. Work with one portion at a time.
</li>        
<li>Flatten each portion of dough to about 1/3 or 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
<li>Use a pasta machine or rolling pin on the dough until it is thin enough
    to see the outline of your hand through it.</li>
<li>Cut the dough sheet in half crosswise. On one half place individual
    teaspoonfuls of ravioli filling around 1 inch apart. Lightly brush dough
    with water around filling.
</li>    
<li>Place the other half of the dough sheet on top of the first. Press around 
    each portion of filling to press out any air and make the seal as
    airtight as possible.
</li>
<li>Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut between the mounds to
    form squares. Transfer ravioli to a baking sheet lightly dusted with flour.
</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add
    the ravioli to the pot. Cook uncovered while carefully stirring for 6 minutes
    or until the filling is hot. Drain well.
</li>
</ol>
